# Training Facilitator Guide

The purpose of this document is to include all necessary information regarding the preparation and planning of the workshop.

# Pre-workshop

A couple of questions are sent out to the registered participants before the event. The purpose is to understand their current level of knowledge and interest in the topic of using Git-like repos for software development, metadata for software and training materials, making FAIR training materials, making FAIR software, evaluating the FAIRness of training materials and software objects.

Based on the answer analysis three groups of participants are identified
- group focused on development of FAIR training materials
- group focused on FAIR software with novice skills in GitHub and similar repos
- group focused on FAIR software familiar with GitHub that should be more focused on FAIR assessment

For the online presenters, a backup recording has been made in case there is a problem with the online presentation.

# During the workshop

The first part of the workshop is organised in a classical presentation style where information about both projects and activities is presented.

After the coffee break, in the second part of the workshop a hands-on activity is performed.

## Hands-on activity organisation 

The room is organised in a cabaret style and participants are using their laptops to perform the activity.

The workshop organisers act as facilitators during this stage.

All necessary materials and how-tos are shared with the participants at the beginning of part two.

Participants are divided according to group, then split into smaller groups of 3-5 people.

Each small group needs to choose a representative that will give a brief overview of their experience at the end of part two.

After the retrospection of the groups, an interactive Q&A session is held using Menti.

At the end, the workshop is concluded.

# After the workshop

Links to all relevant materials are shared with the participants.
