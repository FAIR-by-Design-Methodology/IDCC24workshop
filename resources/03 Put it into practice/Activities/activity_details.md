# Put it all into practice

This is the hands-on part of the FAIR-by-Design workshop, where participants should try to put into practice the methodologies and guidelines discussed in the first part of the workshop.

## Activity duration - 1 hr

## Number of people that it can be performed with - up to 20 participants

## Goal of activity

Get a hands-on experience with the essential steps of the FAIR-by-Design methodology to produce FAIR digital objects. 

## Materials
- all digital materials are available at https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/IDCC24workshop/latest/
- participants should have their own laptops with Internet access

## Instructions

At the beginning of the session trainers should group people into 3 groups based on their answers to the pre-workshop questions.

These groups are then divided into subgroups of 3s and 4s and sat together.

The participants are provided with the link to the digital materials and are asked to follow the steps of the activity assigned to each separate group.

The trainers (physically and online) support the participants by answering questions and helping them with any problems completing any of the assigned steps.

5 mins before the end the trainers remind the participants to jump to the last step and prepare for a retrospective.

At the end of the activity, each sub-group leader provides a short report on the activity (how it went, what did they learn, etc.) All discuss the retrospective input together, and then move on to the workshop feedback Menti Q&A.


## Tips and Tricks

- the activity is very difficult to perform online as the progress of the participants can not be monitored effectively
- trainers should be fluent in the use of GitHub, MD and all related online editors
