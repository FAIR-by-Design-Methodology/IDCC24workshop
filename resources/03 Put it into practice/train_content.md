## Learning Content Topic

Here goes the content of the learning unit divided into a number of subtopics and any additional headings as necessary.

Use blank rows to divide between paragraphs.

References to external or internal content provided elsewhere should be linked with [hyperlinks](https://pages.github.com/).

Example numbered bullets:

1. numbered list one
2. two
3. three

Example unnumbered list.

- unnumbered list

### Images

To add an image, first place the image in the /attachments folder and then use a relative link similar to above using a ! in front. 
All images should be located in the attachments folder that is on the same level with the content file.

Don't forget attribution if the image was not created by you. If you are reusing images or text clear attribution should be provided as in the example above. Same applies in case of reusing text or other type of content. Be careful to follow the attribution rules as provided by the image source (in the example above it is Pixabay).

### Accessibility

Using headings and subheadings, lists and alternative text for images is extremely important so as to ensure accessibility of the content for people with impairments. Also, take care to choose the appropriate color pallette for images.

### Tables

Tables are a bit tricky in md, the easiest way to create them is to use a tool that will generate the md code that you can then just copy paste in your content file.
One such tool that can be used is the [Markdown Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) available online. The provided example table has been generated using this tool. 

| **Column 1 title** | **Column 2 title**  |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| content 1          |      content 4      |
| content 2          |      content 5      |
| content 3          | content 6 content 7 |
