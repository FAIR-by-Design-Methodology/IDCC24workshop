# Unit Plan

## Activities

The main goal of the Putting it all into practice unit is to enable the workshop participants to try out some of the essential steps when it comes to the development of FAIR digital objects, be it learning materials or research software, as well as the basics of assessing the FAIRness of the digital object.

### Location
- cabaret style room, with tables where participants are groups by 3s or 4s

### Total duration - 1 hr

### Number of attendees
- up to 20 participants

### Learning objectives
- describe research software using metdata
- publish research software on Zenodo
- archive research software on Software Heritage
- analyse the FAIR-by-Design templates for learning materials
- use the RDA metadata schema for learning resources
- discover the trainer and learner content that should be defined for each learning unit
- assess level of FAIRness of learning materials or software objects

### Plan
Participants are called out to group into 3s or 4s based on their answers from the pre-workshop survey:

1. interested in developing learning materials
2. interested in developing FAIR software with low level of GitHub knowledge
3. interested in FAIR software with fair knowledge of GitHub

Group 1 will do the FAIR learning materials activity with the guidance of Skills4EOSC physical and online trainers.

Group 2 will do the FAIR research software activity with the guidance of Skills4EOSC & FAIR-IMPACT physical and online trainers.

Group 3 will do the FAIR assessment activity with the guidance of FAIR-IMPACT physical and online trainers.

In the last 5 minutes the participants are reminded to jump to the last step of the activity to prepare for the retrospective and conclusion of the workshop.
