# Unit Lesson Plan Template

## Unit Name

Aim/Goal of unit

### Location
- is it going to be online or physical
- if physical any special room type should be noted (e.g. classroom, IT lab, ...)

### Total duration

### Number of attendees
- important to know the max group size
- can be a number range (e.g. 20-30)

### Learning objectives
- list the learning objectives that are to be achieved
- learning objectives should be devised using the verbs from the Bloom's Taxonomy
- learning objectives should be SMART

### Plan
| Duration | Topic                  | Key points/Teaching Method/Questions                                   | Activities               | Resources                  |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| X mins   | Welcome / Introduction | - housekeeping  - introduce trainer and trainees - learning objectives | ice breaker              | e.g. name tags, flip chart |
| X mins   | The hook               | - focus attention - provide framework                                  | brainstorm expectations  | e.g. post-it notes         |

| X mins   | Guided practice        | trainer acts as facilitator                                            | exercise or activity     | e.g. posters and markers   |
| X mins   | Summary                | key takeaways                                                          | reinforcement assignment | e.g. cards                 |

Note: If the training is relying heavily on presentations then another option for the plan layout is to provided in a slide by slide using slide thumbnails in the topic column. In this case each row in the table should refer to a separate slide in the presentation.

- is it going to be formative (throughout) or summative (in the end)
