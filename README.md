# IDCC24 W6 - FAIR-by-Design: introducing Skills4EOSC and FAIR-IMPACT Materials Repository

This repository hosts all of the materials used to prepare and hold the FAIR-by-Design workshop at IDCC'24.

The FAIR community is continuously seeking to enable an increasingly broad range of FAIR research outputs including research software and educational resources. This workshop aims to showcase and test recent outputs from the FAIR-IMPACT and Skills4EOSC projects that help stakeholders integrate FAIR-enabling activities into their workflows:

- Skills4EOSC presents their FAIR-by-Design Methodology which can be used to create FAIR outputs, and 
- FAIR-IMPACT shares recent efforts to develop recommendations and related metrics to support the FAIRness of research software.
